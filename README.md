# The-Collatz-Conjesture Visualizer

The Collatz Conjecture is an unsolved problem in mathematics that involves starting with any positive integer, and then following a series of steps to eventually reach the number 1. The conjecture states that, no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.

This project provides a web-based visualizer for the Collatz Conjecture. Users can enter a positive integer, and the web app will display the steps needed to reach 1 for that integer. The app also plots the path taken for each integer entered, creating a graph of the sequences for comparison.

**##Getting Started**
To use this web app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can visit the live demo on '[**myPage**]([https://collartz.netlify.app/])) .

**###Usage**
To use the app, enter a positive integer in the input field and press enter. The app will display the steps needed to reach 1 for that integer, as well as a graph of the path taken.

The app can also be used to compare the paths taken for multiple integers. Simply enter a new integer, and the graph will update to show the new path alongside the existing ones. The graph will only show the 10 most recently entered integers, and will remove older entries as new ones are added.
