Collatz Conjecture
Introduction
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that states that for any positive integer n, the sequence obtained from the following algorithm will eventually reach 1:

If n is even, divide it by 2.
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
This project is a web-based application that implements the Collatz Conjecture algorithm and visualizes the sequence of numbers.

Requirements
The following technologies are required to run this application:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Installation
To install and run the application, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Usage
The application allows the user to input a positive integer and generate the sequence of numbers according to the Collatz Conjecture algorithm. The sequence is displayed in a table, with each number in a separate row. The user can also reset the input and start again with a new number.

Conclusion
This project is a simple implementation of the Collatz Conjecture algorithm and a visualization of the sequence of numbers. It can be used as a learning tool to understand the concept and the behavior of the algorithm.
